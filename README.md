Customer Churn Prediction in Telecom Industry

Problem:
Analyse data of the telecom company and find insights to stop the customers from
churning out to other telecom companies.

Data:
customer-churn-data.csv has 7043 rows and 21 columns

Solution:
 Conducted data manipulation tasks to extract and analyze critical customer information.
 Utilized data visualization techniques to gain insights into customer behavior.
 Built three distinct models using Keras to predict customer churn:
 Predicted churn using 'tenure' as the feature with a sequential model.
 Enhanced the first model with dropout layers for improved performance.
 Developed a third model incorporating 'Tenure,' 'Monthly Charges,' and 'Total Charges' for a holistic analysis.
 Evaluated model performance using confusion matrices and plotted 'Accuracy vs Epochs' graphs for each model.
